            Electrical safety is not something most people think about day to day — until something goes wrong. 
            Smoke alarms and electrical systems are designed to protect lives and property, but only when they 
            are installed correctly, maintained properly, and tested regularly.

            Interconnected smoke alarms are particularly effective in larger homes and multi-level properties,
