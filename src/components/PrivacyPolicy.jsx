            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              At NZXTGEN Pty Ltd, we value your privacy and treat your information with care.
              This policy explains how we collect and use information in the most minimal and respectful way, simply to help us deliver great service.

            <h2>2. What We Collect (and Why)</h2>
            <p>
              We only collect basic information that you choose to share with us — like your name and contact details — when you fill out a form on our website (for quotes, bookings, or general enquiries).
              We may also collect general website data (like page visits or page loading speed) to help improve how our site works — nothing personal or invasive.

            <h2>3. How We Use That Info</h2>
            <p>
              We use your info to:
              <br />• Respond to your enquiry or quote request
              <br />• Organise services you’ve asked us to deliver
              <br />• Make your experience smoother on our site
              <br /><br />
              We don’t use your info for marketing spam, and we don’t keep anything we don’t need.

            <h2>4. Who Sees Your Info</h2>
            <p>
              We never sell or trade your information.
              In some cases, we may share it with trusted service providers (like electricians or technicians we work with), but only when necessary to complete a job — and always with confidentiality in mind.
