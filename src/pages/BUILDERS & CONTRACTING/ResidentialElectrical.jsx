                Our residential electrical services are designed to support homeowners with safe,
                compliant, and well-planned electrical solutions that suit everyday living.
              </p>
              <p className="residential-text">
                We work across all areas of the home, providing electrical installations, upgrades,
                repairs, and maintenance that improve safety, functionality, and long-term reliability.
                We handle a wide range of common residential electrical needs, including:

              <p className="residential-text">
                Beyond standard installations, we also assist with more involved electrical work such
                as partial or full rewiring, switchboard upgrades, and electrical planning for
                renovations or new builds. These services are particularly important in homes with
                ageing electrical infrastructure or increased power demands due to modern appliances
                and technology.

                  Every residential job is completed with a strong focus on safety and compliance.
                  Electrical work in the home must meet Australian Standards not only to function
                  correctly, but also to protect occupants from risks such as electrical fires,
                  shocks, and system failures. We ensure all work is tested, labelled where required,
                  and installed neatly to suit the home environment.
                </p>
                <p className="residential-text">
                  Our approach is straightforward and transparent. We take the time to explain what
                  work is required, what options are available, and why certain recommendations are
                  made. This allows homeowners to make informed decisions without confusion or
                  unnecessary complexity.

            <h2 className="residential-section-title">When You Need a Residential Electrician</h2>
            <p className="residential-text">
              Homeowners engage residential electricians for a wide range of reasons, from small
              improvements to major upgrades. One of the most common reasons is improving usability
              within the home, such as adding power points in convenient locations, upgrading
              lighting for better visibility, or installing ceiling fans to improve comfort.
            </p>
            <p className="residential-text">
              Renovations and extensions almost always require professional electrical planning and
              installation. Kitchen and bathroom upgrades involve specific safety requirements,
              zoning rules, and load considerations. Having a licensed electrician involved early
              ensures the electrical layout supports the finished space without last-minute changes
              or compliance issues.
            </p>
            <p className="residential-text">
              Older homes often require electrical attention due to outdated wiring, overloaded
              circuits, or insufficient power capacity. Warning signs may include:
            </p>
            <ul className="residential-list">
              {warningSigns.map((item) => (
                <li key={item}>{item}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
            <p className="residential-text">
              Addressing these issues early reduces safety risks and helps bring the home up to
              current standards. Electrical upgrades can also improve energy efficiency and
              accommodate modern appliances, home offices, and smart technology.
            </p>
            <p className="residential-text">
              Electrical services are also important when preparing a property for sale or rental.
              Compliance with safety requirements, particularly smoke alarms and electrical
              condition, is often necessary. Proactive upgrades can help avoid delays and ensure the
              property is ready for occupancy.

                NZXTGEN understands that residential electrical work is carried out in lived-in
                spaces. We work respectfully within occupied homes, taking care to minimise
                disruption, protect surfaces, and maintain a clean and organised work area
                throughout the job.

              <p className="residential-text residential-text-light">
                We provide practical advice based on how households use their space. Rather than
                offering generic solutions, we consider furniture layouts, appliance usage, future
                needs, and safety requirements when planning installations. This results in electrical
                systems that are both functional and adaptable over time.
