                Electrical work plays a critical role in how a property functions, both now and into

              Electrical services are required at various stages of a property's lifecycle. New
              builds require full electrical design and installation, while renovations often involve
              upgrading or reconfiguring existing systems.

              Ongoing electrical support is also essential for small businesses that rely on
              consistent power and safe infrastructure. Regular upgrades and maintenance help prevent
