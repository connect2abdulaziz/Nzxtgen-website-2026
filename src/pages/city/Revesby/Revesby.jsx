              <p className="canterbury-lead">
                Revesby is a well-established suburb with a strong mix of long-standing family homes,
                modern duplex developments, and small commercial premises. Over time, the electrical
                demands of properties in the area have changed significantly. Where homes once ran a
                handful of appliances, they now support air conditioning, upgraded kitchens, home
                offices, security systems, and smart technology. This shift means electrical systems
                need to be reliable, compliant, and designed for modern use.
              </p>
              <p>
                NZXTGEN provides professional electrical services throughout Revesby, working closely
                with homeowners and small businesses who want practical solutions delivered properly.
                We also regularly service surrounding areas such as Condell Park and Georges Hall,
                which share similar housing styles and infrastructure challenges. Our focus is on
                safe installations, clear communication, and electrical work that stands up over
                time.

                    Electrical work in Revesby often involves upgrading or adapting existing systems
                    rather than starting from scratch. Many properties have undergone renovations or
                    extensions, which can place additional load on older wiring or switchboards if
                    upgrades were not planned correctly.

                <p>
                  Revesby's blend of older homes and newer developments creates a range of electrical
                  requirements. Our work in the area is often driven by safety upgrades, lifestyle
                  changes, and renovation projects.

                  <h3>Older Homes and Electrical Safety</h3>
                  <p>
                    Many established homes in Revesby were built before modern safety standards were
                    introduced. While these properties may still function, they often lack adequate
                    safety switch protection or sufficient circuit capacity.
                  </p>
                  <p>We regularly carry out:</p>
                  <ul className="canterbury-list">
                    {safetyList.map((item) => (
                      <li key={item}>{item}</li>
                    ))}
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Addressing these issues early helps reduce fire risk, prevent nuisance tripping,
                    and ensure the home can safely support additional appliances.

                  <h3>Renovations and Extensions</h3>
                  <p>
                    Home renovations are common across Revesby, particularly kitchen and bathroom
                    upgrades or second-storey additions. Electrical work during renovations needs to
                    be planned carefully to avoid surface cabling or future limitations.
                  </p>
                  <p>Our renovation-related services include:</p>
                  <ul className="canterbury-list">
                    {renovationsList.map((item) => (
                      <li key={item}>{item}</li>
                    ))}
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    By working alongside renovation teams, we help ensure electrical systems are
                    installed at the right stages and finished cleanly.

                  <h3>Work-From-Home and Lifestyle Changes</h3>
                  <p>
                    Like many suburbs, Revesby has seen an increase in home-based work and flexible
                    living arrangements. This often highlights weaknesses in existing electrical
                    layouts, such as limited power points or poor lighting in study areas.
                  </p>
                  <p>We provide practical upgrades such as:</p>
                  <ul className="canterbury-list">
                    {lifestyleList.map((item) => (
                      <li key={item}>{item}</li>
                    ))}
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    These changes improve day-to-day usability without overcomplicating the
                    electrical system.

                <p className="canterbury-why-choose-text">
                  Choosing an electrician is about more than availability. It's about trust,
                  workmanship, and understanding how the property is used. NZXTGEN takes a practical
                  approach to electrical work, focusing on long-term reliability rather than quick
                  fixes.
                </p>
                <p className="canterbury-why-choose-text">
                  Our familiarity with properties in Revesby, Condell Park, and Georges Hall allows us
                  to anticipate common issues such as limited roof access, older switchboards, or mixed
                  wiring systems. This experience helps projects run more smoothly and reduces
                  unexpected delays.
                </p>
                <p className="canterbury-why-choose-text">
                  We also understand that electrical work often needs to fit around busy households or
                  business hours. Reliable scheduling and open communication are central to how we
                  operate.
