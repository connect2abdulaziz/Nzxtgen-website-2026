                Strathfield is a well-established suburb known for its mix of large family homes,
                modern apartments, schools, and local businesses. Properties in the area range from
                older brick homes with ageing electrical systems to newly built residences requiring
                carefully planned electrical layouts. This variety means electrical work in
                Strathfield often requires a considered, property-specific approach rather than
                one-size-fits-all solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                NZXTGEN provides professional electrical services across Strathfield, supporting
                homeowners and small businesses with safe, compliant, and practical electrical work.
                We regularly attend jobs in neighbouring areas such as Burwood and Concord, where
                property styles and electrical demands closely mirror those found in Strathfield. Our
                local experience allows us to anticipate common issues and deliver solutions that
                suit how people live and work in the area.

                    Electrical needs in Strathfield often reflect the suburb's balance of older
                    residences and modern developments. Many homes have undergone renovations over time,
                    resulting in a mix of original and updated wiring. Without proper assessment, this
                    can lead to safety risks, capacity issues, or inefficient layouts.

                  <p>NZXTGEN offers a broad range of electrical services tailored to Strathfield properties, including:</p>

                <p>
                  Strathfield's location and development history create several recurring electrical
                  scenarios. Our experience working locally, including nearby Burwood and Concord,
                  means we are familiar with the challenges these properties often present.

                  <h3>Older Homes and Electrical Capacity</h3>
                  <p>
                    Many family homes in Strathfield were built when electrical demand was far lower
                    than it is today. As households add air conditioning, modern kitchens, home
                    offices, and entertainment systems, existing wiring and switchboards can struggle
                    to cope.
                  </p>
                  <p>Typical issues we address include:</p>
                  <ul className="canterbury-list">
                    {capacityIssuesList.map((item) => (
                      <li key={item}>{item}</li>
                    ))}
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Upgrading these systems improves safety and ensures the home can support modern
                    living without ongoing electrical issues.

                  <h3>Renovations and Extensions</h3>
                  <p>
                    Renovations are common in Strathfield, particularly extensions to accommodate
                    growing families or upgrades to improve functionality. Electrical work during
                    renovations needs to be carefully planned to avoid costly changes later.

                  <p>We regularly assist with:</p>
                  <ul className="canterbury-list">

                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Early involvement helps ensure the finished space functions as intended and
                    remains compliant.

                  <p>
                    Strathfield has seen an increase in apartment living, bringing different
                    electrical considerations compared to standalone homes. Shared infrastructure,
                    limited access, and strata requirements all need to be managed correctly.

                  Electrical work is not just about installation; it's about trust, clarity, and
                  long-term reliability. NZXTGEN focuses on delivering electrical services that are
                  technically sound and appropriate for the specific property and its occupants.

                <p className="canterbury-why-choose-text">
                  Our familiarity with the housing stock and infrastructure in Strathfield, as well as
                  surrounding areas like Burwood and Concord, allows us to quickly identify common
                  issues such as mixed wiring systems, limited switchboard capacity, or previous
                  non-compliant work. This experience helps projects progress smoothly and reduces
                  unexpected delays.

                <p className="canterbury-why-choose-text">
                  We also understand that electrical work often needs to fit around busy schedules.

                  efficiently while maintaining high standards of safety and quality.
