              <p className="canterbury-lead">
                Panania is a well-established residential suburb where family homes, small commercial
                premises, and community facilities sit side by side. Many properties in the area were
                built decades ago and have since been upgraded in stages, often resulting in
                electrical systems that no longer match modern usage. From growing families relying
                on multiple appliances to small businesses needing reliable power throughout the day,
                electrical work in Panania requires practical solutions that are safe, compliant, and
                built to last.
              </p>
              <p>
                NZXTGEN provides professional electrical services across Panania, working with
                homeowners and small businesses to resolve everyday electrical issues and deliver
                well-planned upgrades. We also regularly attend jobs in surrounding areas such as
                Milperra and East Hills, where similar property styles and electrical challenges are
                common. This local experience helps us deliver electrical work that suits how
                properties in this area are used.

                  <p>
                    Electrical needs in Panania are often shaped by older housing stock combined with
                    modern expectations. Many homes have been renovated over time, with new kitchens, air
                    conditioning, home offices, or outdoor living areas added to original structures.
                    Without careful electrical planning, this can place unnecessary strain on wiring and
                    switchboards.
                  </p>
                  <p>NZXTGEN offers a wide range of electrical services tailored to these conditions, including:</p>

                <p>
                  Because Panania features a mix of long-standing homes and gradually updated
                  properties, certain electrical issues arise more frequently. Our experience in the
                  area means we can identify these issues quickly and recommend solutions that are
                  appropriate rather than excessive.

                  <h3>Ageing Electrical Infrastructure</h3>
                  <p>
                    Many Panania homes were built when electrical demand was far lower than today. As
                    households add modern appliances, entertainment systems, and cooling solutions,
                    older wiring and switchboards may struggle to cope.
                  </p>
                  <p>Common signs include:</p>
                  <ul className="canterbury-list">
                    {ageingSignsList.map((item) => (
                      <li key={item}>{item}</li>
                    ))}
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Upgrading these systems improves safety, reliability, and overall usability,
                    while also reducing the risk of electrical faults.

                  <h3>Outdoor and Backyard Electrical Work</h3>
                  <p>
                    Panania homes often feature generous backyards and outdoor entertaining areas.
                    Electrical work in these spaces needs to be carefully installed to withstand
                    weather exposure and ongoing use.
                  </p>
                  <p>We regularly assist with:</p>

                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    All outdoor electrical work is completed to current safety standards, ensuring
                    durability and peace of mind.

                  <h3>Small Business Electrical Requirements</h3>
                  <p>
                    Small businesses in Panania often operate from converted residential properties
                    or compact commercial spaces. Electrical systems in these settings need to be
                    reliable without causing unnecessary downtime.

                  <p>NZXTGEN supports local businesses by:</p>

                  <p>
                    Our goal is to ensure electrical systems support business operations rather than
                    hinder them.

                <p className="canterbury-why-choose-text">
                  Choosing an electrician isn't just about getting the job done—it's about ensuring
                  the work is appropriate for the property and safe for long-term use. NZXTGEN takes a
                  straightforward, professional approach to electrical services, focusing on clarity,
                  quality workmanship, and compliance.
                </p>
                <p className="canterbury-why-choose-text">
                  Our familiarity with Panania and nearby suburbs like Milperra and East Hills allows
                  us to anticipate common challenges such as mixed wiring systems, limited switchboard
                  capacity, or previous non-compliant installations. This local knowledge helps reduce
                  delays and ensures work is completed efficiently.
                </p>
                <p className="canterbury-why-choose-text">
                  We also understand that electrical work often needs to fit around family routines or
                  business hours. Wherever possible, we schedule work to minimise disruption and keep
                  the process straightforward.
