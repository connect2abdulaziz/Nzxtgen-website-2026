              <p className="fault-lead">
                Electrical fault finding is the process of accurately identifying the underlying cause
                of electrical problems rather than simply addressing surface symptoms.
              </p>
              <p className="fault-text">
                Many electrical issues appear minor at first but can indicate deeper faults within
                wiring, circuits, switchboards or connected equipment. Our fault-finding service is
                designed to locate these issues safely, efficiently and with minimal disruption.
              </p>
              <p className="fault-text">
                We use a structured diagnostic approach that includes visual inspection, circuit
                testing and targeted investigation. This allows us to pinpoint faults such as damaged
                wiring, loose connections, overloaded circuits, insulation breakdown or failing
                electrical components. Rather than replacing parts unnecessarily, we focus on
                identifying the exact source of the problem.

                  Once a fault is clearly identified, repairs are carried out to restore safe and
                  reliable operation. This may involve repairing or replacing damaged cabling, correcting
                  circuit imbalances, upgrading protective devices or resolving switchboard issues. All
                  repair work is completed in line with Australian Standards and tested thoroughly
                  before the system is returned to service.

                <p className="fault-text">
                  Fault finding and repairs are often interconnected. Effective diagnostics ensure
                  repairs are precise and durable, reducing the likelihood of recurring issues. This
                  approach saves time, limits unnecessary disruption and improves the overall
                  reliability of the electrical system.

            <h2 className="fault-section-title">When You Need Fault Finding</h2>
            <p className="fault-text">
              Fault finding is required when electrical issues persist, recur or behave
              unpredictably. While some electrical problems are obvious, others develop gradually
              and may go unnoticed until they cause disruption or safety concerns.
            </p>
            <p className="fault-text">Common signs that fault finding is needed include:</p>
            <ul className="fault-list">
              {commonSigns.map((item) => (
                <li key={item}>{item}</li>
              ))}
            </ul>
            <p className="fault-text">
              These symptoms often indicate underlying issues such as deteriorating wiring, loose
              connections, moisture ingress or overloaded circuits. Ignoring these signs can
              increase the risk of electrical failure, fire hazards or damage to connected
              appliances.
            </p>
            <p className="fault-text">
              Fault finding is also valuable in situations where changes are planned, or risks need
              to be assessed. This includes purchasing older properties, preparing for renovations
              or addressing unexplained electrical behaviour. Identifying faults early allows issues
              to be resolved before new loads or upgrades are introduced.
            </p>
            <p className="fault-text">
              In commercial or rental properties, fault finding may be required to maintain safety,
              meet compliance obligations or ensure uninterrupted operation. Even minor electrical
              irregularities can have broader impacts on equipment, lighting or safety systems.
              Early investigation reduces the likelihood of emergency repairs and helps extend the
              life of existing electrical infrastructure.
