              Emergency electrical services are required when an issue presents an immediate risk to
              people, property, or essential operations. These situations should not be delayed, as
              electrical faults can escalate quickly if left unaddressed.

            <p className="emergency-text">You should seek urgent electrical assistance when experiencing:</p>

                  Homes may require emergency support when faults occur outside normal hours or when
                  safety is compromised. Issues such as water leaks near power points, storm-related
                  damage, or sudden switchboard failures should always be treated as urgent.

                  Small businesses may also require emergency electrical assistance when outages disrupt
                  operations, compromise safety systems, or impact compliance obligations. Electrical
                  faults in commercial settings can affect staff safety, customer access, and
                  operational continuity, making fast response essential.

              In many cases, emergency issues are linked to underlying problems such as ageing wiring,
